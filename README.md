# Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree:  
This repository contains all of my completed solutions for advent of code 2022. 
Each folder contains the code for each day's challenge. All puzzles were completed in python3.  
  
#### My favorites this year were:
1. [**Day 5: Supply Stacks**](https://github.com/shutch42/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/Day_05) - Move stacks of crates in order according to instructions.
2. [**Day 7: No space left on device**](https://github.com/shutch42/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/Day_07) - Create a file tree with file/directory sizes from text of *cd* and *ls* instructions on a command line.
3. [**Day 10: Cathode Ray Tube**](https://github.com/shutch42/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/Day_10) - Implement simple assembly instructions (nop, addx) and render text output from instructions.
4. [**Day 11: Monkey in the Middle**](https://github.com/shutch42/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/Day_11) - While monkeys throw around your items, you can calculate where the items will be thrown based on mathematical operations. To prevent numbers from getting too high, use modulo algebra.
5. [**Day 14: Regolith Reservoir**](https://github.com/shutch42/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/Day_14) - Simulate the movement of sand falling from the ceiling of a cave.
