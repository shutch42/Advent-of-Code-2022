# Day 5
This one was pretty cool. The challenged involved parsing an input, which includes a guide for moving freight containers using different methods. In part 1, containers are moved one at a time. In part 2, multiple containers in a stack are moved at once. My solution to this involved manipulating queues that contained each stack of boxes. However, my favorite part of this problem was making an animation of the solution! The result is shown below. As you can see, the animation on the left only moves one box at a time, while multiple containers are moved at once on the animation to the right.
